# Yahoo Finance Statistics Data Scraper 

The 'GET THE METERICS' gets meterics from the txt file ('Yahoo_StatMeterics.txt') and orders them by key. Ultimately, these are the meterics that is going to be retrieved from Yahoo for the tickers. 'GET THE INFO' section retrieves the data using the get_stats function which takes a list of ticker symbols (make sure the correct ticker symbol is used as Yahoo adds endings for different exchanges, for example Suncor Energy Inc. on the TSX would be SU.TO [https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN2310.html]). The ouput is a txt file but I have added an option to convert txt file to csv ('CONVERT TXT FILE TO CSV'). I have added 'GET ADDITIONAL INFO', which retrieves extra info from Yahoo (sector, industry, business summary, website, full-time employees) and does numerical formatting. The file that this uses is the csv file converted from the txt file (from 'GET THE INFO' section).
